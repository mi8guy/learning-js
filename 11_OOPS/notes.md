# Javascript and classes.

Js does have classes. This feature was introduced in ES6. However, it is important to note that JS is prototype based language, and its classes are a primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms.  
In other words, it provides more familiar syntax for developers coming from class based languages such as Java or C++, but under the hood it works somewhat differently.  


## OOP
This is a programming paradigm. Simply meaning, your code writing style, structure. There are other paradigms like functional, procedural andmany more.This is just a process.

In Javascript, there are Objects.


## Object
- Collection of properties and methods.
- toLowerCase, Promises are all Objects.

## Why use OOP
Code used to get meesy. aka Spagetti code.
OOP facilitates use of more features like services in JS.

## Parts of OOP
- Object literal {}
- Constructor functions
  - `new` keyword creates empty object
  - constructor function call because of new keyword, packs all arguments,
  - `this` keyword injects all arguments
  - you get this instance  
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances(new, this)

## 4 pillars
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
